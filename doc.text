Hey There.

1. How this web application is played

You just need to start typing The code will be automatically generated has soon as you press keys. You can change themes and songs


2. How to open the files localy

There is no server. We just have index.html, styles.css, index.js and a music folder where some songs are stored
you just need to copy the path of index.html file and paste it in the browser. Thats sit. You can now run the application localy.

Thanks.
Happy Coding.
